Once upon a time in a small software company, there was a team of developers working on a new application. They were constantly running into issues with version control, often finding themselves struggling to keep track of changes and merge different versions of the code.
The team leader, Sarah, recognized the need for a better solution and decided to implement a new version control system. After some research, she decided to introduce a popular version control tool called Git.
